# ARC-AI Transport Prototype Session — 2025-11-10

## Conversation Snapshot

1. **User** requested a comprehensive ARC-AI transport simulation project scaffold with specific services, features, tests, and documentation.
2. **Assistant** delivered the implementation plan, created the repo structure, implemented services (main hub, mini hubs, network simulator), tooling, tests, and README, and reported status.
3. **User** asked to install dependencies, check connectivity, and run tests. The assistant attempted installation; `orjson` failed because no wheel exists for Python 3.14 and Rust/Cargo was absent.
4. **User** asked for an explanation, auto-run, and verification. The assistant summarized outputs, noted the environment blocker twice, and documented TODO updates.
5. **User** requested saving the chat. This file records the key points of the interaction for future reference.

## Notes

- Full project located at `arc_ai_net_sim/` with services (`main_hub`, `mini_hub`, `network_sim`), shared modules (`common`), tools, tests, and docker-compose.
- Dependency installation pending due to Python 3.14 + missing Rust; recommend Python 3.11+ virtual environment or installing Rust/Cargo.
- TODOs tracked in repository session: environment setup, running services, and executing tests remain blocked until dependencies install.
